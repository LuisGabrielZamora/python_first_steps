# List Practices

ItÂ´s the first Laboratory with List Data Type.

## Section Goals

1. Learning and managing lists in Python.
2. Create new values in List.
3. Delete values in List.
4. Print ranges in List.
5. Loops and control sentences to create List.

### Exercise 1. Laboratory Dangerous Samples

Instructions: In a genetic laboratory, exists 100 samples, and they know them like this: SAMPLE_001, SAMPLE_020, SAMPLE_100.

**Steps:**
**1. Create database named sampleTests as a list with a loop (for or while).**

sampleTests = ['SAMPLE_001', 'SAMPLE_002', ... , 'SAMPLE_100']
   
**2. Create database named valuesBasic with the next conditions:**

* From 1 to 25 samples, system set random values from 1 to 9.
* From 26 to 100 samples, system set value zero to all.
* Print name of SAMPLE and VALUE like this: SAMPLE_001 = 0.5, with user choose.

**3. All the sample divisible with position by 5**

* Change the name SAMPLE_006 for SAMPLE_DIVISIBLE_5_006.

**4. Create database named valuesDangerours with next conditions:**

* From 1 to 25 samples, system set value zero to all.
* From 26 to 100 samples, system set random values from 20 to 100.
