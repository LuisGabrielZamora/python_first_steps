print(f'Tuple length: {len(fruits)}')

print(fruits[0])

# Inverse Access
print(fruits[-1])

# Tuples range
print(fruits[0:1])

# Access tuples with for
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Convert tuple to list
print(f'Tuple: {fruits}')
listFruits = list(fruits)
listFruits[0] = 'Pera'
fruits = tuple(listFruits)
print(f'New Tuple: {fruits}')
